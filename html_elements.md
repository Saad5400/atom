The HTML code we provided includes the following elements:


Document Type Declaration:
`<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML being used.

HTML Document Structure:
`<html lang="en">`: Specifies the root element of the HTML document with the language attribute set to "en" (English).

Head Section:
`<head>`: Contains meta-information about the HTML document.
            Meta tags for character set, viewport, and description.
            Title tag for the page title.
            Link tag for the favicon.
            Meta tag for theme color.
            Links to external stylesheets for fonts and boxicons.
            Script tags for loading Tailwind CSS and a custom JavaScript file.
            Style tag for defining Tailwind CSS styles.

Body Section:
`<body>`: element in HTML represents the content of an HTML document, including text, images, links, and other elements, visible on the web page.
`<div>`: element in HTML is a container that groups and organizes content, allowing for styling and layout control through CSS.

Most sections contain various HTML elements such as headings: (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), images (`<img>`), links (`<a>`), forms (`<form>`), span (`<span>`), input (`<input>`), textarea (`<textarea>`), button (`<button>`) along with Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

In HTML Formatting Elements we have `<i>` only (I think).
